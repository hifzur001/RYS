            question: "What is your design process?",
            answer: "My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, I create interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users to refine the design."

        {
            question: "What tools and software do you use for UX design?",

            question: "How do you measure the success of your UX designs?",
